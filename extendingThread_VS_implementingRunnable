Amond the two ways between "Extends Thread" and "Implements Runnable", "Implements Runnable"
always Prefferable recommended as:-
                In "Extends Thread" our class mandatorily extends Thread class and there is
                no chance pf extending other classes as we can perform multiple inheritance 
                using "extends" with this we also missing the benifits of inheritance
                
                
                But in "Implements Runnable" we can implements and extends multiple classes
                and also perform multiple inheritance. Hence, implements Runnable is
                recommended to define Thread.
