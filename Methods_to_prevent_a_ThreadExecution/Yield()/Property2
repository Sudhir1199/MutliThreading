//the thread will execution after and before yield() depends on Thread priority
//high priority executes first and ends first but its depends on OS mostly because OS like Windows doesnot provide proper support for Thread priority

OS :- Windows 10

class MyThread1 extends Thread{
	@Override
	public void run() {
		// TODO Auto-generated method stub
		System.out.println("Started "+Thread.currentThread());
		Thread.yield();
		
		System.out.println("Ended "+Thread.currentThread());
	}
}


public class yield_preventExecution {

	public static void main(String[] args) {
		// TODO Auto-generated method stub
		MyThread1 t1 = new MyThread1();
		MyThread1 t2 = new MyThread1();
		
		t1.setPriority(3);
		t2.setPriority(8);
		
		
		t1.start();
		t2.start();
		
		
	}

}
o/p:-
Started Thread[Thread-0,3,main]
Started Thread[Thread-1,8,main]    -----As u can see windows are not supporting Thread priority
Ended Thread[Thread-1,8,main]
Ended Thread[Thread-0,3,main]
