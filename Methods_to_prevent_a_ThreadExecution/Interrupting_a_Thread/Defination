The interrupt() method of thread class is used to interrupt the thread. if any thread 
is in sleeping or waiting state (i.e sleep() or wait() is invoked) then usind interrupt()
method, we can interrupt the thread execution by throwing InterruptedExecution.


- Whenever we calling interrupt() method we may not see the effect immediately, if
the target thread is in sleeping or waiting state then thread will be interrupted 
immediately.

-If the target Thread is not in sleeping or waiting state then interrupt call will wait
until the thread enters into sleeping or waiting state. Once target enter into
sleeping or waiting state interrupt method show its effect on that thread.

-If in the lifecycle of thread, the thread doesn't entered any sleeping or waiting 
state then the its simple waste for interrupt() method to have there.
