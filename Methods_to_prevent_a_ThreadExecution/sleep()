If a Thread don't want to perform any operation for a particular duration
of time then we should go for sleep() method

Overloaded methods of sleep:-
public static void sleep(long ms) throws InterruptedException
public static void sleep(long ms, long ns) throws InterruptedException







new/born ---->runnable/ready ------>Running ----->dead/Terminated
                ^                       |
                |                       |Thread.sleep(2000)
 |--------------|                       |Thread.sleep(1000,5688)

 |                      SLEEPING---->Thread went to sleeping state 
 |                        state
 |
 1) if time expires
 2) if sleeping Thread got Interrupted
 
 so here at the time of current thread executing or running, when we invoke Thread.sleep()
 method that current Thread running state will change by Thread scheduler and went into 
 sleep state and after given amount to time expire or if sleeping thread got interrupted 
 then it will goes to ready/runnable state and waiting for its chance of getting execution.
